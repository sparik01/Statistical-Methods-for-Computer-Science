If we want to know whether getting the flu is independent of vaccinations then we need to determine the value of P(flu and Vaccinations), P(flu), and P(vaccinations).  From problem 1 we already determined that P(flu) = 0.06768.  We can calculate P(vaccinations) = (number of vaccinations)/total number of people potentially exposed).

This is much lower than initially expected from a test that is fairly accurate having an 86% chance of a positive result in people with the flu.  This discrepancy in the probability can be attributed to the very low rate of actually having the flu.  Since only a small portion of the population actually get the flu, it makes sense that only a small portion will test positive.\n",

Therefore, this can mean that it is more likely to have a positive diagnosis that is true (and the flu test works better) when the ratio of the number of people who have the disease to the number of people who do not have the disease is at least 0.19.  This is much larger to the actual given rate of the disease of 2%, demonstrating that we are likely to have inaccurate results. However, if there is a higher number of people that get the flu as already shown above, the ratio of false positives to true positives also improves:"

    "Conclusions about Flu Vaccinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "From Problem 2 we determined how the number of flu cases is dependent on the number of flu vaccinations and saw just how important flu vaccinations are to whether or not someone actually gets the flu. Due to this dependency, we can assume that the number of flu cases would go down with an increased number of vaccinations.  This makes sense with the  herd mentality theory of how more people getting a vaccine would help protect one person as well as the community.  When people are vaccinated it will be harder for someone else to get infected with the flu making it more difficult for the flu to spread accross the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Problem 1 we also saw just how signficiant getting the flu vaccine is to the overall outcome of getting or not getting the flue.  For example, if the probability of getting the flu is about 6.8%, the likelihood of getting the flu is less than 1% (actually 0.211%) if you just get the vaccine.  However, the likelihood of getting the flu is much higher at 9% if you do not get vaccinated.  We can also look at the people who got the flu and see how many of those people had actually gotten the vaccine.  As per Problem 1, part d, we calculated how less than 1% of the people who had gotten the flu were vaccinated.  That means that 1-0.00821 or roughly 99% of those people who had gotten the flu were people who never got the vaccine (calculation also shown below).  We are assuming that the numbers reported are all true positives and no false positives.  However, even if any of the numbers were false positives, it is still very apparent how getting the flu vaccine overwhelmingly lessens the chances of someone getting the flu. "

    "Recommendations for the Governor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since actually testing for whether you have the flu is affected by the prevalence of the flu, I don't believe that that testing alone should be used as a way to control the spread. I would urge the governor to encourage people to get vaccinated as soon as vaccines are available rather than just getting tested.  His bill should include educating the public and promoting the importance of getting flu vaccinations rather than just for flu testing. Although testing for the virus is important for understanding the spread and potentially determining the length of the flu season, it doesn't directly impact the spread of the virus, whereas getting vaccinated does directly impact the spread. If most of the population would get vaccinated as easly as possible, it would also reduce the chance of pre-symptomatic spreading of the flu. As it is less likely to get the flu if someone is vaccinated, we could assume that less people would go to the physician to get tested, which may also reduce the number of tests performed that result in false positives.  Overall, the governor should focus on explaining the important of the flu vaccine and encouraging the people to get vaccinated as soon as the flu vaccines become available rather than only encouraging people to just get tested for the flu."
